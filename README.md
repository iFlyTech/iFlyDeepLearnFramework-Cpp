# iFlyDeepLearnFramework-Cpp

Full explanation of the projects can be found in this [article](https://foundationsofdl.com/2022/02/12/neural-network-from-scratch-part-5-c-deep-learning-framework-implementation/).

## Description

The aim is to demonstrate how a project in C++ is developed, specifically a Deep Learning framework, and how various C++ concepts are used. It includes aspects like abstract classes/interfaces, inheritance, memory management, pointers, constexpress, templates, std containers, eigen matrix, static functions, makefile, etc.

The developed framework will implement MSE loss, linear layer, ReLU and softmax activation functions, a feature/label generator and a mini-batch learning function.
